# .vimrc

This repository contains my personal Vim configuration file, `.vimrc`. It is used to customize and enhance the Vim (Vi IMproved) text editor with my preferred settings, key mappings, plugins, and workflow optimizations.

## Purpose

The `.vimrc` file is Vim's primary configuration file, allowing users to tailor the editor's behavior and appearance. By storing it in a version-controlled repository, I can:

- Safeguard against loss of my custom setup.
- Easily synchronize my Vim configuration across different machines.
- Share my setup with others or reference it for troubleshooting.

## Requirements

To use this configuration to its fullest, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Vim (latest version recommended, especially on Ubuntu):**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install vim
  ```
  > For the absolute latest Vim, consider installing from a PPA or building from source.

- **[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)** (for fast file searching):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ripgrep
  ```

- **[universal-ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags)** (for code navigation):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install universal-ctags
  ```
  > If `universal-ctags` is not available in your package manager, [build from source](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags#readme).

- **[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)** (plugin manager):  
  Install with:
  ```bash
  curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
  ```
  
  I actually use it with neovim:
  ```bash
  sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
  ```

## Features

- Custom key mappings for improved productivity.
- Sensible default settings for indentation, search, and interface.
- Plugin management setup with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
- Color scheme preferences.
- Language-specific configuration snippets.
